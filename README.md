# üéÆ GG-Deals Scraper Bot

A robust Discord notification bot that periodically scrapes [GG-Deals](https://gg.deals) for the latest game offers, evaluates potential profits from reselling on platforms like Kinguin and G2A, and sends detailed notifications directly to your Discord webhook.

This project is intended for **demonstration purposes only** and is **not fully functional** in its public form. Certain core components have been intentionally removed or modified to prevent misuse or unauthorized deployment.

If you're a recruiter or interviewer and would like to see the complete working version, feel free to reach out ‚Äî I'm happy to provide access upon request.
